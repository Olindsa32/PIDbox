## Ultrasonic Sensor Code






# Onshape Drawing
Owen's part of the project.
Created box to hold parts


## Design Ideas
LCD slot
Mount for motor
Wheel goes inside holder that is screwed to the wall
Ultrasonic Sensor goes on top
LED goes right below wheel to create strobe effect while it is spinning fast.

## Pictures of Near Finished Design

This motor holder has now been replaced with a different interpretation of a motor holder. The reason for this is because this design was not attached to the same plane as the the rest of the wheel setup, meaning that if the motor moved at all when it was running it could unalign from the wheel setup and make the whole thing not work. New design is attached to the wheel holder meaning if one vibrates and moves things it will move both together.

The clear cover on top of the wall with the wheel holder has now been scrapped

## Final Changes to the Wheel Area

## New Design for Wheel Holder with New Motor Holder

The new motor holder is a near exact fit and will use screws on either side to clamp down on the motor after putting it in. I also made the wheel larger and added a whole for an LED light that will have a blink effect when the wheel goes over it.
