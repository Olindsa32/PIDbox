# Ultrasonic PID Box
Repository for Owen and Evan's Ultrasonic-Controlled PID Box Projectâ„¢



# Python Code
Evan's part of the project.
Coded Ultrasonic Sensor, Photointerrupter and Motor


## Outine code

# Onshape Drawing
Owen's part of the project.
Created box to hold parts


## Design Ideas
LCD slot
Mount for motor
Wheel goes inside holder that is screwed to the wall
Ultrasonic Sensor goes on top
LED goes right below wheel to create strobe effect while it is spinning fast.

The clear cover on top of the wall with the wheel holder has now been scrapped

## Final Changes to the Wheel Area

## New Design for Wheel Holder with New Motor Holder

The new motor holder is a near exact fit and will use screws on either side to clamp down on the motor after putting it in. I also made the wheel larger and added a whole for an LED light that will have a blink effect when the wheel goes over it.
